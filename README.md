# repo-list-front

New VueJS 3.0 project was setup with vue-cli because it was recommended from vue get started guide, **but after using it in future I will prefer use Vite(https://vitejs.dev/) OR some prepared templates like Vitesse(https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-lite).** vue-cli got problem with install CSS preprocessors and not fully OK with Vue3.
